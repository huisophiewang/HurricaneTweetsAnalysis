The locational accuracy of a geotagged tweet depends on how a Twitter user shares his/her location when posting a tweet.
The location can be shared in the format of place names (e.g. country, state, city) 
or the exact latitude and longitude (point-level, determined by the device’s GPS or other signals such as cell tower).

Temporal Matthew-related dataset contains the tweets (64,189) from the five affected states during the time period Matthew was active in the region (October 2nd–October 11th, 
the lowest spatial accuracy was kept to the state level. 

Temporal Evacuation-related dataset is a subset of the previous dataset composed of 7,735 tweets 
in the states that ordered voluntary or mandatory evacuations for Matthew 

Spatial Matthew-related dataset only includes the tweets with city-level and point-level accuracy. 
The keywords were kept similar to the temporal analysis. The number of tweets contained in this dataset was 54,509.

To determine the universe of Twitter users in the study area, a dataset (Twitter Population) containing 4,706,685 tweets 
within the time span from September 15th, 2016 to October 15th, 2016 was extracted for the five affected states.
